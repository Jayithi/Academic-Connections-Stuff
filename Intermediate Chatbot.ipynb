    "### Retrieval-Based Models\n",
    "\n",
    "**What They Do:** Retrieval-based chatbots look through a predefined set of responses and pick the best one based on the user's input. \n",
    "\n",
    "**How They Work:**\n",
    "1. **Predefined Responses:** They have a list of possible answers stored in advance.\n",
    "2. **Matching:** When a user asks something, the chatbot matches the question to the most relevant response from its list.\n",
    "3. **Selection:** It then selects and displays the best response it found.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** If you ask a retrieval-based chatbot, \"What’s the weather today?\" it might look up responses related to weather queries and choose a pre-written response about today’s weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:** \n",
    "- Simple to implement.\n",
    "- Good at providing accurate responses if questions are predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:** \n",
    "- Limited by the responses it has.\n",
    "- Cannot handle unexpected questions well.\n",

    "### Generative-Based Models\n",
    "\n",
    "**What They Do:** Generative-based chatbots create responses from scratch using learned patterns from data. They generate replies based on the input they receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How They Work:**\n",
    "1. **Learning from Data:** They are trained on large amounts of conversation data.\n",
    "2. **Generating Responses:** When you ask a question, the chatbot generates a new, unique response based on what it has learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** If you ask a generative-based chatbot, \"Tell me a joke,\" it might create a new joke based on patterns it has learned from previous jokes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Can handle a wide range of topics and questions.\n",
    "- Produces more natural and varied responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- More complex to build.\n",
    "- Responses might be less predictable and require careful tuning."
